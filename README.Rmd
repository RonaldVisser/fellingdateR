This package offers a set of functions that can assist you to infer felling date estimates from dated tree-ring series. The presence of (partially) preserved sapwood  allows to estimate the missing number of sapwood rings ( ? in figure below), and to report an interval in which the actual felling date is situated. 

![](man/figures/cross-section.png)

This procedure can be implemented for individual series as well as for a group of timbers. 

Where it can be assumed that a group of historical timbers were all felled at the same time (i.e. in the same year), but due to the absence of the bark/cambial zone (waney edge) and the last formed tree ring this cannot be assessed, the preserved sapwood rings can be used to infer a date range for the felling date.

Taking into account the observed number of sapwood rings on all samples and combining them into a single estimate, is likely to provide a more accurate and precise estimate of the felling date year for the group of timbers under study.

Furthermore, an additional function provides a tool to sum sapwood probability distributions, comparable to 'summed probability densities' commonly applied to sets of radiocarbon (^14^C) dates.


## Installation

You can install the development version of fellingdateR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
#install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("hanecakr/fellingdateR")
```

## Basic example

In the following example the combined felling date range for a set of five dated tree-ring series is computed:

```{r basic-example}
library(fellingdateR)

## a data set where all series have partially preserved sapwood:
trs_example1
```

```{r example}
sw_combine(trs_example1, plot = TRUE)
```

The light grey distributions represent the probability density function of the felling date range for each individual series. The dark grey distribution is the combined estimate for a common felling date. 

The sapwood data used in the example above to estimate the felling date range, was published by Hollstein in 1980:

```{r model_sapwood_counts, dpi=200}
sw_model("Hollstein_1980")
```


## Getting started

You can find an overview of the **main functions** and **sapwood datasets** distributed with the package in the [documentation](https://hanecakr.github.io/fellingdateR/reference/).

Some practical examples are provided in the [`getting started`](https://hanecakr.github.io/fellingdateR/articles/getting_started.html) vignette.


## Genreal workflow

The `fellingdateR`-package allows to fully document the methodology to establish a felling date -- for a single
timber or a group of timbers -- making the whole procedure reproducible and could assist to build standardized workflows when applied to large datasets of historical tree-ring series originating from geographically
distinct regions. The package offers several functions that are related to each step in the (generalized) workflow when working with tree-ring series from (pre-)historical objects or constructions

## Motivation & citation

This package was developed during the analysis of a large data set of tree-ring series that originate from medieval timber constructions in [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges) (Belgium). The results of this study were published in [*Dendrochronologia*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/dendrochronologia).
