# Estimating felling dates from historical tree-ring series

> The functions presented on this Github repository will help you infer felling date estimates from dated tree-ring series with patrially preserved sapwood.

## Motivation

These R scripts and functions were developped during the analysis of a large set of tree-ring data that were taken from medieval timber constructions in the town of Bruges (Belgium). The results of this study are presented in a paper that was submitted to _Dendrochronologia_ and is currently under peer review.
