# fellingDateR: estimating felling dates from historical tree-ring series

The set of functions presented on this Github repository will help you infer felling date estimates from dated tree-ring series with partially preserved sapwood. Furthermore, an additional function provides a tool to sum sapwood probability distributions, comparable to 'summed probability densities' commonly used for sets of radiocarbon (^14^C) dates.

Where it can be assumed that a group of historical timbers were all felled at the same time (i.e. the same year), but due to the absence of the bark/cambial zone (waney edge) and the last formed tree ring this cannot be assessed, the preserved sapwood rings on core samples can be used to infer a date range for the felling date. Taking into account the observed number of sapwood rings on all samples and combining them into a single estimate, is likely to provide a more accurate and precise estimate of the felling date year for the group of timbers under study. It is assumed that this estimate of the felling date is closely related to the construction date of the timber structure or building phase that was sampled for tree-ring analysis and dating.

## Motivation

These R scripts and functions were developed during the analysis of a large set of tree-ring data that originate from medieval timber constructions in the town of [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges) (Belgium). The results of this study are presented in a paper that is submitted to [ _Dendrochronologia_ ](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/dendrochronologia) and is currently under peer review.

### Content

The [:file\_folder: R](/R) directory contains the R-script for each function.


## Overview of sapwood R-functions
### sapwood_PDF

The function `sapwood_PDF()` computes the probability density function (PDF) for the estimated felling dated, derived from the number of observed sapwood rings, on a core sample or cross section from a timber, and a chosen sapwood model that gives the probability for any number of sapwood rings (as observed on samples with a complete pith to bark sequence).

The examples below all rely on published sapwood models for European oak \(_Quercus robur_ L. and _Quercus petraea_ (Matt.) Liebl.).

The `sapwood_PDF()`-function takes 5 arguments:

  - swr = the observed number of sapwood rings on a timber
  - last = a calendar date for the last measured tree ring on a dendrochronologically dated sample (optional)
  - model = should be one of `c("Holstein_1980", "Wazny_1990")` (more models will be added later)
  - hdi = `TRUE/FALSE` whether the highest probability density interval (hdi) should be computed or not (relies on package `HDInterval`)
  - credMass = number [0, 1] that assigns the credibility mass associated with the hdi
  
Output is a `data.frame` with 3 variables:

  - `year`: ascending sequence staring at 0 when `last` is not set to a calendar year, or starting from the calendar year of the last observed sapwood ring 
  - `swr`: ascending sequence starting at the observed number of sapwood rings
  - `p`: probability associated with the number of sapwood rings (`swr`), based on the sapwood model provided

```{r}
source("./R/sapwood_PDF.R")
require(tidyverse)

# 8 sapwood rings observed and the Hollstein 1980 model as a reference:

sw1 <- sapwood_PDF(swr = 8, last = 1234, model = "Hollstein_1980")

# plot the probability distribution of the 'truncated' sapwood model:

ggplot(sw1) +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = p), fill = "burlywood2", color = "burlywood4") +
  theme_minimal()

```

The hdi delineates an interval in which the actual felling date is most likely situated. It is the shortest interval within a probability distribution for a given probability mass or credible interval. The hdi summarizes the distribution by specifying an interval that spans most of the distribution, say 95% of it, such that every point inside the interval has higher credibility than any point outside the interval.

In the example below, 10 sapwood rings were observed on a sample (last ring dated to 1234 AD) that is supposed to have a provenance in the Southern Baltic  region (sapwood model published by Wazny, 1990). The full sapwwood model is shown with a black outline. The highlighted part of the distribution shows the truncated distribution at 10 observed sapwood rings and the horizontal line depicts the 95.4% credible interval for the felling date of the tree. 

```{r}
library(HDInterval) 
# this package assist in computing the highest probability density interval
# https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HDInterval 

# the 'full' sapwood model (Wazny 1990)
sw2 <- sapwood_PDF(swr = 0, last = 1224, model = "Wazny_1990")

# the 'truncated' sapwood model when 7 sapwood rings are observed
sw3 <- sapwood_PDF(swr = 10, last = 1234, model = "Wazny_1990")

# the highest probability density interval (hdi), with a credible interval of 95.4%
sw4 <- sapwood_PDF(swr = 10, last = 1234, hdi = TRUE, credMass = 0.954, model = "Wazny_1990")

sw4

```


```{r}
ggplot(sw2) +
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = p), fill = NA, color = "black") +
  geom_area(data = sw3, aes(x = year, y = p), fill = "burlywood2", color = "burlywood4") +
  geom_segment(aes(y = .005, yend = .005, x = sw4["lower"], xend = sw4["upper"])) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### sapwood_combine()

A function that attemps to estimate the shared felling date for a set of dated tree-ring series with (partly) preserved sapwood.

```{r}
# some test-data

# all series have partially preserved sapwood
dummy1 <- data.frame(
  keycode = c("trs_1", "trs_2", "trs_3", "trs_4", "trs_5"),
  Date_end = c(1000, 1009, 1007, 1005, 1010),
  SWR = c(5, 10, 15, 16, 8),
  Waneyedge = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))

# one series has an exact felling date (= waney edge preserved)
dummy2 <- data.frame(
  keycode = c("trs_1", "trs_2", "trs_3", "trs_4", "trs_5"),
  Date_end = c(1000, 1005, 1008, 1000, 1010),
  SWR = c(5, 10, NA, 1, 3),
  Waneyedge = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))

# multiple felling dates
dummy3 <- data.frame(
  keycode = c("trs_1", "trs_2", "trs_3", "trs_4", "trs_5"),
  Date_end = c(1000, 1005, 1008, 1000, 1010),
  SWR = c(5, 10, NA, 1, NA),
  Waneyedge = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE))

# combination of series with and without sapwood rings
dummy4 <- data.frame(
  keycode = c("trs_1", "trs_2", "trs_3", "trs_4", "trs_5"),
  Date_end = c(1000, 1005, 1005, 1020, 1040),
  SWR = c(5, 10, NA, 1, 0),
  Waneyedge = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))

# series without preserved sapwood 
dummy5 <- data.frame(
  keycode = c("trs_1", "trs_2", "trs_3", "trs_4"),
  Date_end = c(1000, 1005, 1000, 1000),
  SWR = c(NA, NA, NA, NA),
  Waneyedge = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))
  
```


```{r}
source("./R/sapwood_combine.R")

# example of the output generated by `sapwood_combine` when `hdi` is TRUE
swc1 <- sapwood_combine(dummy1, hdi = TRUE, credMass = .90, model = "Hollstein_1980")

str(swc1)

```


### sapwood_comb_plot()

`sapwood_comb_plot()` provides an easy-to-use function to plot the output of `sapwood_combine()` with `ggplot()`.

For each individual series the probability density for the number of sapwood rings (i.e. the date range in which the actual felling date is situated) is displayed, according to the chosen sapwood model. The combined probability density for the shared felling date is highlighted in dark grey. A horizontal line delineates the _highest probability density interval_ (hdi) according to the chosen credible interval (`credMass`).

The `dummy1` set of simulated tree-ring series might share a common felling date. According to the `sapwood_combine()` output this shared felling date is situated between 1010 and 1018 AD. 

```{r, warning = FALSE}
source("./R/sapwood_comb_plot.R")

sapwood_comb_plot(dummy1, credMass = .954, model = "Hollstein_1980")

```

When the waney edge is preserved and the tree-ring series can be dated, an exact felling date can be determined. When grouped with other series from the same building phase, it can be assessed whether the other series with preserved sapwood rings go together with this exact felling date.

```{r}

sapwood_comb_plot(dummy2, credMass = .954, model = "Hollstein_1980")

```

Series _trs_3_ has no preserved sapwood. The arrow points away from the earliest possible felling date for this tree-ring series.

`dummy_3` is a simulated data set with series that have different felling dates. Hence, no common felling date can be presented.

```{r}

sapwood_comb_plot(dummy3, credMass = .954, model = "Hollstein_1980")

```

For this set of tree-ring series, no common felling date can be estimated. Probably this dataset contains tree-ring series from different building phases or includes reused, older timbers.

```{r}

sapwood_comb_plot(dummy4, credMass = .954, model = "Hollstein_1980")

```

Ony a _terminus post quem_ or 'earliest possible felling date' can be computed when no sapwood is preserved.

```{r}

sapwood_comb_plot(dummy5, credMass = .954, model = "Hollstein_1980")

```

### sapwood_SPD()

Computes a _summed probability density_ for a set of tree-ring series with (partly) preserved sapwood.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
source("./R/sapwood_SPD.R")
source("./R/MovAv.R")

dummy6 <- data.frame(
  keycode = c("trs_1", "trs_2", "trs_3", "trs_4", "trs_5", "trs_6", "trs_7", "trs_8", "trs_9"),
  Date_end = c(1000, 1009, 1007, 1005, 1010, 1020, 1025, 1050, 1035),
  SWR = c(5, 10, 15, 16, 8, 0, 10, 3, 1),
  Waneyedge = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)
  )

# Compute the summed probability density for the `dummy6` data set. The resulting SPD is not scaled to 1 and a running mean with a bandwidth of 11 years is added.

spd <- sapwood_SPD(dummy6, scale_p = FALSE, run_mean = TRUE, w = 11)

head(spd, 15)

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggformula) # for geom_spline()

spd %>%
select(year, SPD, SPD_MovAv) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = SPD), fill = "lightblue", color = "lightblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_spline(aes(x = year, y = SPD_MovAv), nknots = 20, color = "red3") +
  xlim(1000, 1100) +
  xlab("Calendar year") +
  theme_minimal()
          
```
