# `fellingdateR`: estimating felling dates from historical tree-ring series

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


This R-package offers a set of functions that will help you to infer felling date estimates from dated tree-ring series. The presence of (partially) preserved sapwood or waney edge allows to estimate a range for the actual felling date, for individual series as well as for a group of timbers. Furthermore, an additional function provides a tool to sum sapwood probability distributions, comparable to 'summed probability densities' commonly applied to sets of radiocarbon (^14^C) dates.

Where it can be assumed that a group of historical timbers were all felled at the same time (i.e. the same year), but due to the absence of the bark/cambial zone (waney edge) and the last formed tree ring this cannot be assessed, the preserved sapwood rings can be used to infer a date range for the felling date. Taking into account the observed number of sapwood rings on all samples and combining them into a single estimate, is likely to provide a more accurate and precise estimate of the felling date year for the group of timbers under study. It is assumed that this estimate of the felling date is closely related to the construction date of the timber structure or building phase that was sampled for tree-ring analysis and dating.


## Installation

You can install the development version of fellingddateR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hanecakr/fellingdateR")

```

## Examples

The following example shows a felling date estimate for a set of four dated tree-ring series:

```{r}
## a dataset where all series have partially preserved sapwood
dummy1 <- data.frame(
  series = c("trs_1", "trs_2", "trs_3", "trs_4", "trs_5"),
  last = c(1000, 1009, 1007, 1005, 1010),
  n_sapwood = c(5, 10, 15, 16, 8),
  waneyedge = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE))
dummy1
```


```{r example}

library(fellingdateR)
# basic example

sw_combine(dummy1, plot = TRUE)

```

The sapwood data used in the example below was published by Hollstein in 1980:

```{r model_sapwood_counts}

sw_model("Hollstein_1980")

```


## Motivation

This package was developed during the analysis of a large data set of tree-ring series that originate from medieval timber constructions in the town of [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges) (Belgium). The results of this study are presented in a paper published in [_Dendrochronologia_](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/dendrochronologia).

## Main functions

### sw_interval 

This function computes the probability density function (PDF) and highest probability density interval (hdi) of the felling date range baased on the observed number of sapwood rings, their chronological dating and the selected sapwood data and model.

```{r}
# The following code computes the PDF of sapwood estimates, or limits of the hdi for the felling date.
# In the example below, 10 sapwood rings were observed on a sample (last ring dated to 1234 AD) that is supposed to have a provenance in the Southern Baltic  region (sapwood model published by Wazny, 1990).
# The hdi delineates an interval in which the actual felling date is most likely situated. It is the shortest interval within a probability distribution for a given probability mass or credible interval. The hdi summarizes the distribution by specifying an interval that spans most of the distribution, say 95% of it, as such that every point inside the interval has higher credibility than any point outside the interval.

sw_interval(n_sapwood = 10,
            last = 1234,
            hdi = TRUE,
            credMass = .95, 
            sw_data = "Wazny_1990", 
            densfun = "lognormal")
```

When `hdi = FALSE` a matrix is returned with scaled p values for each number of observed sapwood rings.

```{r}
# 8 sapwood rings observed and the Hollstein 1980 sapwood model:
pdf <- sw_interval(n_sapwood = 10,
            last = 1234,
            hdi = FALSE,
            credMass = .95, 
            sw_data = "Wazny_1990", 
            densfun = "lognormal")

full <- sw_interval(n_sapwood = 0,
            last = 1224,
            hdi = FALSE,
            credMass = .95, 
            sw_data = "Wazny_1990", 
            densfun = "lognormal")

# plot the probability distribution of the 'truncated' sapwood model:
ggplot2::ggplot(pdf) +
  ggplot2::geom_area(ggplot2::aes(x = year, y = p), fill = "burlywood2", color = "burlywood4") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
```

### fd_report

### sw_combine and sw_combine_plot

## Helper functions

### sw_data_overview

The function `sw_data_overview` provides an overview of all published sapwood data sets that are distributed with this package.

```{r}

sw_data_overview()

```

### sw_data_info

More information on one of the sawpood data sets - how to cite the data set, the area the data represents, the number of observations and some basic summary stats - can be retrieved by the `sw_data_info` function.

```{r}

sw_data_info("Pilcher_1987")

```

### sw_model

A graphical representation of the sapwood data sets is provided by the `sw_model` function. 

```{r}

sw_model("Sohar_2012_ELL_c")

sw_data_info("Sohar_2012_ELL_c")


```
This function allows to fit a distribution to a data set of observed sapwood numbers and computes the highest posterior density interval (hdi) for a given credibility mass.
The density function fitted to the sapwood data set should be one of:

   * "lognormal" (the default value),
   * "normal",
   * "weibull",
   * "gamma".
   
The credible interval should be a value between 0 and 1.

```{r}

sw_model("Wazny_1990", densfun = "gamma", credMass= .90, plot = TRUE)

```

When `plot = FALSE`, a list with the numeric output of the modelling process is returned.
