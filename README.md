# Estimating felling dates from historical tree-ring series

> The functions presented on this Github repository will help you infer
> felling date estimates from dated tree-ring series with patrially
> preserved sapwood.

## Motivation

These R scripts and functions were developped during the analysis of a
large set of tree-ring data that were taken from medieval timber
constructions in the town of Bruges (Belgium). The results of this study
are presented in a paper that was submitted to *Dendrochronologia* and
is currently under peer review.
